# CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application
### Overview
This repository contains the source code and configuration files for implementing a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for a web application. The CI/CD pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery of updates to the application.

# CI/CD Pipeline
### What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices in software development that automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository (CI) and then deploying them to production (CD). The CI/CD pipeline helps streamline development workflows, improve code quality, and accelerate the release cycle.

# Benefits
### Automation: Automates repetitive tasks such as testing, building, and deployment.
### Consistency: Ensures consistency in deployment processes across different environments.
### Quality: Facilitates early detection of bugs and issues through automated testing.
### Speed: Accelerates the delivery of updates and new features to end-users.
### Setup
### Prerequisites
### Before setting up the CI/CD pipeline, ensure you have the following:

Access to a version control system (e.g., Git)
CI/CD tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions)
Cloud platform for deployment (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
Configuration files for environment-specific settings (e.g., .env files)

# Steps to Setup

### Version Control System:
Ensure your web application source code is hosted in a version control system like GitHub.

### CI/CD Tool Setup:
Choose and configure a CI/CD tool that integrates with your version control system.
Set up necessary build, test, and deployment scripts/configurations in your CI/CD tool.

### Pipeline Configuration:

Define stages and jobs in your CI/CD pipeline:
Build Stage: Compile source code, run build tasks (e.g., minification, bundling).
Test Stage: Execute automated tests (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).
Deploy Stage: Deploy application to staging or production environment.

### Deployment Configuration:
Configure deployment scripts or integrations to deploy the web application to your chosen cloud platform.

### Environment Management:
Manage environment-specific configurations using environment variables or configuration files.
Ensure sensitive information (e.g., API keys, credentials) is securely managed and encrypted.

### Monitoring and Logging:
Set up monitoring and logging to track application performance and detect issues post-deployment.
